    <h2>Oatmeal healthy cookies</h2>

    <p>I made these oatmeal chocolate chip cookies by modifying Beatrice's Excellent Oatmeal Cookies recipe. My
        boyfriend went crazy over them! I've never seen him enjoy cookies to that extent! He said I blew his mother's
        recipe away.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to follow</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time,
            until well combined; stir in vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until just blended. Mix in quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips.
            Drop batter by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for a few minutes before
            transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
